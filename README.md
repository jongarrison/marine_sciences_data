## Running 

To get the jupyter notebooks running, start a terminal, cd into the JupyterEnvironment directory and:

    source run_server.sh

In the logs of the running server you will see a url like:

127.0.0.1:8888/tree?token=SuperSecretToken

Copy that and load one of the ipynb file in VSCode. Choose select a kernel and paste in that url starting with the domain (do not include the protocol). Choose Python3 when it is offered and you should be running.
